# Towards Symmetry-sensitive Pose Estimation: A Rotation Representation for the Symmetric Objects in T-LESS
(Soon to be) Under review at IJCV 

Implementation of our rotation representation, inverse mapping and the categorization of symmetry classes  are available in [sym_representation.py](./src/sym_representation.py)

For the visualization and visual verification run [visualization.py](./src/visualization.py)

The plots have been pre-rendered into interactive html-files which can be found at: [View visualization](https://akriegler.github.io/SARR/)

(COMING SOON) A video of these plots with some explanations is available at: [View video](https://github.com/akriegler/SARR/tree/main/video/verification.mp4)
